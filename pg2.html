    <h2>The inappropriate or excessive use of artificial light</h2>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Glare – excessive brightness that causes visual discomfort</p>
    <p>Skyglow – brightening of the night sky over inhabited areas</p>
    <p>Light trespass – light falling where it is not intended or needed</p>
    <p>Clutter – bright, confusing and excessive groupings of light sources</p>

    <p>According to the 2016 groundbreaking “World Atlas of Artificial Night Sky Brightness,” 80 percent of the world’s population lives under skyglow. In the United States and Europe 99 percent of the public can’t experience a natural night!</p>
    <p>Much outdoor lighting used at night is inefficient, overly bright, poorly targeted, improperly shielded, and, in many cases, completely unnecessary. This light, and the electricity used to create it, is being wasted by spilling it into the sky, rather than focusing it on to the actual objects and areas that people want illuminated.</p>
